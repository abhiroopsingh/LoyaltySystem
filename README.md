# Loyalty System

## Layout

The code is organized into client, server, and proto directories.

The proto directory contains the message and service specifications for how the different parts of the system communicate. This is shared across the clients and server.

This is all stored as [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/).

The clients and server both use [GRPC](http://www.grpc.io/) to communicate using the specifications in the protobufs.
